# Inventory
Hello. This is my first Android Studio app published here.
It's main purpose is to be an inventory app to store pictures,name, price and related details of products for personal use.
Did it for the Android Nanodegree program but got lost in trying to implement the image part x).
Anyway it is done so, yeah, have a look.
